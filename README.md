Here is a descrition of the files in our repository and their contents, by order of importance.
1. Main.jl : This is the file you want to test our results, it contains our best linear (Logistic Classification with ridge regularization) and non linear (Neural-Network) machines. TO GET OUR PREDICTION RESULTS, SIMPLY RUN THIS FILE IN ORDER.
2. Sabirna.jl and juliette.jl : These are simply the files we used for the project to avoid conflicting changes. They contain all the machines we tested, as well as some code for different visualization methods we tried.
3. pca.py : This was a test to use PCA and euclidian distance to classify data, done with python, but it didn't give good results, and was not used for our final results. 
4. test.jl and test.py : Like their names suggests, these are our test files, which we used to get better acquainted with julia outside of a pluto notebook and with git, they contain no relevant code.
